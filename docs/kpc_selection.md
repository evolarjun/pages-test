Project 3: Look for selection in a set of KPC genes from isolates in the Pathogen Detection system
=====================================================================================================

For this project we will be looking at a set of coding sequences downloaded from the NCBI Pathogen Detection System. We'll use HyPhy to detect residues with evidence for positive selection in those sequences. For the sake of efficiency we're using criteria
