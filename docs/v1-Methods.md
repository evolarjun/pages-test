## AMRFinder database

The AMRFinder database is generated at NCBI and curation is ongoing. Recent versions are available at https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogen/Antimicrobial_resistance/AMRFinder/data. For more information on the format and methods used to compile the database see [[AMRFinder database|v1 AMRFinder database]].

## Protein searches (-p)

AMRFinder-prot uses the database of AMR gene sequences, hidden Markov models
(HMMs), the hierarchical tree of AMR protein designations, and a custom
rule-set to generate names and coordinates for AMR genes, along with
descriptions of the evidence used to identify the sequence. Genes are reported
with the following procedure after both HMMER and BLASTP searches are run.

### BLASTP matches

BLASTP is run with the -task blastp-fast -word_size 6 -threshold 21 -evalue
1e-20 -comp_based_stats 0 options against the AMR gene database described
above.  Exact BLAST matches over the full length of the reference protein are
reported. If there is no exact match, then the following rules are applied:
Matches with < 90% identity or with < 50% coverage of the protein are dropped.
If the hit is to a fusion protein than at least 90% of the protein must be
covered. A BLAST match to a reference protein is removed if it is covered by
another BLAST match which has more identical residues or the same number of
identical residues, but to a longer reference protein. A single match is chosen
as the best of what remains sorting by the following criteria in order (1) if
it is exact; (2) has more identical residues; (3) hits a shorter protein; or
(4) the gene symbol comes first in alphabetical order.

### HMM matches

HMMER version 3.1b2 (http://hmmer.org/) is run using the --cut_tc -Z 10000
options with the HMM database described above. HMM matches with full_score
< TC1 or domain_score < TC2 are dropped. All HMM matches to HMMs for parent
nodes of other HMM matches in the hierarchy are removed. The match(es) with the
highest full score are kept. If there is an exact BLAST match or the family of
the BLAST match reference protein is descendant of the family of the HMM then
the information for the nearest HMM node to the BLAST match are returned.

## Translated DNA searches (-n)

Translated alignments using BLASTX of the assembly against the AMR protein
database can be used to help identify partial, split, or unannotated AMR
proteins using the -task tblastn-fast -word_size 3 -evalue 1e-20 -seg no
-comp_based_stats 0 options. The algorithm for selecting hits is as described
above for proteins, but note that HMM searches are not performed against the
unannotated assembly.
